# Tailwind CSS - Styles Not Applying Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied to components. The problem is often due to an incorrectly configured `content` option in the Tailwind configuration file (`tailwind.config.js` or `tailwind.config.cjs`).

**Bug Description:**
The `content` option specifies the files Tailwind should scan for class names. If configured incorrectly, Tailwind may fail to recognize and apply the styles defined in your components.

**How to Reproduce:**
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server. (Command may vary depending on your setup.)
4. Observe that the styles are not being applied correctly.

**Solution:**
The correct configuration is shown in the `bugSolution.js` file.

This fix ensures Tailwind processes all the necessary files and applies the relevant CSS classes correctly.
